**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The document is a prior‑authorization request form for **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) testing** under New York Medicaid (Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield). It specifies that formal psychological testing is *not* indicated for routine screening or brief behavioral assessments; instead, a diagnostic interview and screening measures should precede any testing request. The form is intended exclusively for ASD testing and must be completed on the designated form. Requests for educational testing, learning‑disability assessment, or forensic purposes are not covered. The policy emphasizes that the psychologist must attach supporting clinical/medical records and detail the rationale for testing, including how results will influence treatment.

**Key Points**

- **Scope of Coverage** – Only ASD‑specific psychological or neuropsychological testing is authorized; routine screening or brief behavioral measures are excluded.  
- **Pre‑authorization Requirements** – A diagnostic interview and relevant screening measures must be completed before submitting the request; clinical records must be attached.  
- **Exclusions** – Educational testing, learning‑disability assessment, placement, disability evaluations, and forensic testing are not medically necessary and are excluded.  
- **Authorization Process** – Use Availity Essentials (https://Availity.com) for electronic prior‑authorization requests; phone, fax, or online submissions are also accepted.
