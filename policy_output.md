**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The *CAID Restriction Automation Template* (CAID_RstrAutomationTmplt.xls) is a spreadsheet used by Anthem to standardize the entry of provider specialty and licensing information for California Medicaid (CAID) claims.  The template contains a **User Reference Guide** that explains the required data fields and formatting rules, and a **Provider Specialty List** that maps specialty codes to the states in which they are valid.  The purpose of the template is to ensure that all provider specialty data are entered consistently and in a format that can be automatically processed by Anthem’s claims adjudication system.

**Key Points**

- **Date Formatting** – All date fields (e.g., Specialty Effective Date, Term Date, License Effective Date) must be entered in *date* format, not text, to avoid processing delays.  A leading zero may be hidden but will not cause fallout errors.  
  *Source:* “Ensure cell format is set to “date” format rather than “text” format to avoid processing delays.” (User Reference Guide)

- **Mandatory Fields** – The template requires the following provider‑level data:  
  1. Specialty Effective Date (mandatory)  
  2. Specialty Term Date (optional, only for terminating specialties)  
  3. Specialty Term Reason (optional)  
  4. Provider Organization Specialty and Taxonomy  
  5. State License Number, Issuing Institution, State, Effective/Term Dates, and DEA number (if applicable).  
  *Source:* “Specialty Effective Date…Specialty Term Date…Provider Organization Specialty…State License Number…State DEA Number” (User Reference Guide)

- **Specialty Code Mapping** – The Provider Specialty List lists each specialty code, its description, and the states in which it is valid (e.g., “Clinical Nurse Specialist – CA, CO, NV, CA CAID”).  Only specialties marked “P” (Provider) or “O” (Organization) are accepted.  
  *Source:* “Provider Specialty List” (multiple chunks showing codes and state coverage)

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The document is a *Request for Authorization – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Testing* form used by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield for New York Medicaid (NYC ABC CAID).  It outlines the clinical prerequisites for coverage of formal psychological or neuro‑psychological testing for ASD.  Coverage is limited to cases where a diagnostic interview and appropriate screening measures have already been completed; routine or brief behavioral screening alone is not considered medically necessary.  Requests that are solely for placement, disability, forensic, or educational testing are excluded and must be directed to the public school system.  The form requires attachment of clinical records, documentation of screening tools used, and a summary of the member’s treatment history.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Criteria** – A diagnostic interview *and* relevant screening measures (e.g., ASRS, CARS, SCQ, GARS, SRS, GADS, MCHAT) must be completed before a testing authorization can be granted.  
- **Exclusions** – Routine screening or brief behavioral inventories alone are not covered; placement, disability, forensic, or educational testing requests are not medically necessary and are excluded.  
- **Documentation Requirements** – Attach clinical/medical records, list of screening tools administered, and a detailed treatment history (frequency, duration, current status, symptom improvement).  
- **Telehealth** – Services may be rendered in person or via telehealth; the form allows either modality.

The form limits each request to **no more than three services** and requires detailed information on frequency, intensity, duration, modality, and the member’s goals and objectives.  Providers must attest that the member has elected to receive the requested services and may need to submit the form via email or fax to Anthem’s designated channels.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Request for Authorization: Neuropsychological Testing” form is the official mechanism for obtaining pre‑authorization for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing under Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP. The policy states that neuropsychological testing is **medically necessary** when “there is evidence to suggest that the test results will have a timely and direct impact on the member’s treatment plan for certain indications”【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 1】. Repeat testing to track illness status is generally not warranted unless individually justified. Authorization must be submitted electronically via Availity.com or faxed to 844‑452‑8072, and is subject to verification of member eligibility; it does not guarantee payment【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 3】.

**Key Points**

- **Medical Necessity** – Testing is covered only when evidence shows the results will directly influence the treatment plan for specified indications (e.g., traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, dementia, MS, etc.)【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 1‑2】.  
- **Authorization Requirement** – All neuropsychological testing requests must be pre‑authorized through the form; routine outpatient care does not require authorization, but neuropsychological testing does【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 3】.  
- **Documentation & Submission** – The form requires detailed clinical assessment check‑boxes, ICD‑10 diagnoses, CPT codes, units, and provider signature. Submissions must be electronic or fax; illegible or incomplete requests are rejected【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 1‑3】.  
- **Repeat Testing** – Generally not warranted; repeat testing is considered only on a case‑by‑case basis【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 1】.  
- **Coverage Limits** – The policy does not specify a maximum number of units or a time limit; coverage is contingent on the medical necessity determination and authorization status【source: NY_ABC_CAID_BH_NeuropsychTestingForm.pdf, page 3】.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid (NY ABC CAID BH) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) policy outlines the criteria for medical‑necessary coverage of TMS for adults with severe major depressive disorder (MDD).  Coverage is limited to patients who have failed multiple evidence‑based pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic trials, have documented depressive symptom severity on a standardized rating scale, and meet safety requirements for TMS administration.  The policy requires a completed request form (submitted via Availity or fax) that documents diagnosis, prior treatment history, rating‑scale scores, and device safety criteria.  Coverage is provided by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP, trade name of Anthem HP, LLC.

**Key Points**

- **Diagnosis & Severity** – Must be an adult with a confirmed diagnosis of *severe* MDD (single or recurrent episode) and documented symptom severity on a recognized rating scale (e.g., BDI, HAMD, MADRS, PHQ‑9, etc.).  
- **Prior Treatment Failure** – Patient must have had ≥ 4 trials of psychopharmacologic agents in the current episode, including at least two different drug classes at or above the minimum effective dose and duration, and at least two evidence‑based augmentation therapies; or have intolerable side‑effects from ≥ 4 distinct agents.  
- **Evidence of TMS Response** – If the patient has a prior TMS history, there must have been > 50 % improvement on a standardized rating scale.  
- **Safety & Device Requirements** – TMS must be delivered with an FDA‑approved device for MDD, following the manufacturer’s manual.  Patients with seizure disorders, acute or chronic psychotic symptoms, certain neurological conditions, or implanted magnetic‑sensitive devices within 30 cm of the coil are excluded.  
- **Authorization Process** – A fully completed request form (see PDF) must be submitted via Availity or fax (844‑452‑8072) to obtain prior authorization before treatment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The NY ABC CAID Behavioral Health Quick Reference Guide is a benefit‑grid summary for Medicaid‑managed behavioral‑health services in New York. It applies to **in‑network (INN) providers**; all services rendered by **out‑of‑network (OON) providers** require prior authorization. The guide lists coverage for the four primary Medicaid plans—Health and Recovery Plan (HARP), Child Health Plus (CHPlus), Essential Plan, and Foster Care—as well as for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Services are categorized by type (e.g., outpatient mental health, harm‑reduction, child/family treatment support, residential rehabilitation, emergency services) and indicate whether they are covered, whether authorization is required, and whether a notification is required within two business days (BD) before a concurrent review can be waived.

**Key Points**

- **In‑network vs. Out‑of‑network** – *“This applies to In‑Network Providers (INN providers). All services rendered by Out‑of‑Network Providers (OON providers) require authorizations.”*  
- **Authorization & Notification** – *“Covered — Authorization is not needed for in‑network providers.”*  
  *“Covered — Notification is required within two BD. If notified, then no concurrent review until day 29; if not notified, an ongoing concurrent review will occur.”*  
- **Coverage Scope** – Services such as outpatient mental health (OPMH), harm‑reduction, child/family treatment support, psychosocial rehabilitation, and certain residential rehabilitation services are covered for the four primary plans, while others (e.g., applied behavior analysis, transcranial magnetic stimulation, outpatient detox) are not covered.  
- **Plan‑Specific Exclusions** – Many services are *Not covered* under MMC/SSI, and some are *Covered* only with authorization (e.g., residential rehabilitation for SUD).  

**Policy Information Table**

| Plan | Service Category | Covered? | Authorization Needed? | Notification Required? | OON Status |
|------|------------------|----------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| HARP | Outpatient mental health, harm‑reduction, child/family support, psychosocial rehab | Yes | No (INN) | No | OON requires authorization |
| CHPlus | Same as HARP | Yes | No (INN) | No | OON requires authorization |
| Essential Plan | Same as HARP | Yes | No (INN) | No | OON requires authorization |
| Foster Care | Same as HARP | Yes | No (INN) | No | OON requires authorization |
| MMC/SSI | Many services (e.g., residential SUD rehab, emergency services) | Mixed – many *Not covered* | Yes for covered services | Yes for covered services | OON requires authorization |
| **General** | All plans | *Not covered* services include ABA, TMS, outpatient detox, opioid treatment program, etc. | — | — | — |

*Not specified in document* – Where the quick reference does not list a service, coverage status is considered “Not covered” for that plan.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “NY ABC CAID HEDIS Well‑Child Immunization Coding Bulletin” is a guidance document issued by New York Medicaid (Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield) to help providers accurately code well‑child and immunization visits for HEDIS reporting.  The bulletin lists CPT®, ICD‑10‑CM, and HCPCS codes that should be included on claims to capture weight assessment, counseling, well‑child visits, and childhood immunizations.  The intent is to reduce administrative burden and improve the accuracy of quality‑measure reporting for Medicaid beneficiaries.

**Key Points**

- **Weight Assessment & Counseling** – Use CPT 97802‑97804 and ICD‑10‑CM codes Z68.51‑Z68.54 for BMI percentile and Z71.3 for dietary counseling.  
- **Well‑Child Visits** – Include CPT codes 99381‑99395, 99461 and HCPCS G0438/G0439 (annual wellness visits) or S0302 (EPSDT) to identify first‑30‑month and child‑adolescent well‑care visits.  
- **Childhood Immunizations** – Document at least four DTaP, three IPV, one MMR, and three Hib doses (after 42 days of age) using the appropriate vaccine CPT/HCPCS codes.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield Managed Long‑Term Care (MLTC) Provider Manual is the primary reference for providers participating in Anthem’s New York Medicaid‑approved MLTC program. It outlines the program’s purpose—helping seniors and disabled adults live safely and independently in their homes—its service area (NYC, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester), and eligibility criteria (Medicaid‑eligible, 18 + years, resident of the service area, and determined eligible by the NY State Department of Health). The manual also details operational expectations for providers, including referral procedures, coordination of benefits, over‑payment recovery, and compliance training requirements.  

**Key Points**  

- **Eligibility & Enrollment** – Providers must serve Medicaid‑eligible adults 18 + years who reside in the five NYC counties or Nassau, Suffolk, or Westchester and are determined eligible by the NY State Department of Health’s MLTC assessment tool.  
- **Claims Review & Appeals** – Written requests for review and reconsideration must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the Explanation of Payment (EOP) and include the EOP, claim, supporting documentation, and a statement of disagreement. Anthem will respond within 45 days.  
- **Over‑payment Recovery** – Anthem may offset over‑payments against future claims or require a refund check within 30 days. Failure to refund results in deduction from the next payment.  
- **Compliance Training** – All employees must receive HIPAA privacy and security training at hire and annually thereafter.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The document is Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid’s *Clinical Utilization Management Guidelines* (CUMG) adopted on May 27 2021. It lists the CUMG numbers and titles that apply to pre‑payment review for services that are not covered by another specific guideline. The guidelines cover a broad range of services, including durable medical equipment, laboratory testing, medical devices, surgical procedures, and behavioral health services. The purpose is to provide a framework for determining medical necessity and coverage for these services before payment is authorized.

> “Clinical Utilization Management (UM) Guidelines… adopted by the medical operations committee for our members on May 27, 2021.”  
> (Source: *NY_ABC_CAID_May2021CUMG.pdf*, page 1)

**Key Points**

- **Scope** – The policy enumerates CUMG numbers (e.g., CG‑DME‑03, CG‑LAB‑10, CG‑MED‑54) and their corresponding service titles (e.g., “Durable Medical Equipment,” “Molecular Marker Evaluation of Thyroid Nodules,” “Strapping”).  
- **Coverage Intent** – These guidelines are used for pre‑payment review when no other specific CUMG exists for a service.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Clinical Utilization Management Guidelines” (CUMG) for New York Medicaid, issued by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP, were adopted on **12 Dec 2021**.  The policy establishes the medical‑necessity criteria and pre‑payment review process for a wide range of services when no other specific guideline exists.  It explicitly states that “**Medicaid state contracts, regulatory guidance, CMS requirements and our Medical Policy/Clinical UM Guidelines supersede MCG Care Guidelines**” and that determinations are made “**on a case‑by‑case basis in accordance with the definition of medical necessity that is contained within the Medicaid state contract, regulatory guidance, CMS requirements or in our Medical Necessity Criteria Policy ADMIN.00004**”【source: NY_ABC_CAID_Nov2021CUMG.pdf, lines 772‑782】.  If a request fails to meet the established criteria, it is referred to a licensed physician reviewer with the appropriate clinical expertise【source: NY_ABC_CAID_Nov2021CUMG.pdf, lines 783‑787】.  The guidelines cover a broad spectrum of services—from acupuncture and ambulance transport to durable medical equipment (DME), genetic testing, and imaging—each identified by a unique CUMG number.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Determination** – All services listed under the CUMG numbers are subject to pre‑payment medical‑necessity review; coverage is contingent on meeting the specific criteria outlined in each guideline.  
- **Superseding Authority** – The CUMG supersede MCG Care Guidelines for Medicaid beneficiaries; state contracts, CMS rules, and the internal Medical Necessity Criteria Policy ADMIN.00004 are the governing documents.  
- **Authorization & Review** – Requests that do not meet the criteria are referred to a licensed physician reviewer; many services require prior authorization and adherence to the listed CUMG number.  
- **Scope of Services** – The policy includes categories such as Acupuncture, Ambulance Services (air, water, ground), DME (e.g., wheelchairs, oxygen therapy, prostheses), Home Health, Genetic & Laboratory Testing, Imaging, and many specialty therapies.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield Health Plans (NY ABC CAID) is a Medicaid‑managed‑care program that serves low‑income families, seniors, and people with disabilities in New York City and the surrounding counties. The Provider Manual sets out the rules that participating providers must follow to deliver care to plan members, including credentialing, quality management, utilization review, notification, and payment procedures. The manual is designed to ensure that all care is consistent with New York State Medicaid and federal regulations, that providers meet Anthem’s quality and integrity standards, and that claims are processed efficiently and accurately.  

**Key Points**  

| # | Key Point | Supporting Quote |
|---|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Credentialing** – Providers must hold OMH‑ or OASAS‑licensed credentials or be state‑designated (e.g., HCBS). No employee, subcontractor, or agent may be debarred or suspended by federal or state authorities. | “Anthem credentials OMH‑ and OASAS‑licensed providers as well as other NYS‑designated providers…We require all licensed providers not employ or contract with any employee…who has been debarred or suspended…” (Chunk 256) |
| 2 | **Utilization Review & Authorization** – Most services require precertification via the PLUTO tool or a delegated UR agent. Time‑frames follow NYS Article 49 and the most stringent NCQA standards. | “Precertification Lookup tool online (PLUTO). Anthem is available to respond…Utilization Review Delegation…All delegated agents follow the Anthem UR processing guidelines, including time frames…” (Chunk 403) |
| 3 | **Notification** – Providers must notify Anthem by phone or fax before rendering covered services to verify member eligibility and provider status. | “Notification is defined as the requirement for the provider to notify Anthem by telephone or fax of the intent to render covered medical services to a member…Notifications can be called in to 800‑474‑3530 or faxed to 800‑964‑3627.” (Chunk 403) |
| 4 | **Payment & Claims** – Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is preferred; claims must be submitted within 90 days of service. Certain supplies and services (e.g., specific implants, anesthesia supplies, and temporary devices) are non‑reimbursable. | “Electronic claims payment through electronic funds transfer (EFT)…Claims must be submitted on original red claim forms…We use Optical Character Reading (OCR) technology…Examples of non‑reimbursable items/services codes…” (Chunks 596 & 647) |
| 5 | **Implements Definition** – Implants are devices that remain in the member’s body after discharge; temporary devices (staples, sutures, drains) are not reimbursed. | “Implants are objects or materials which are implanted…Instruments that are designed to be removed or discarded…Staples, sutures, clips, as well as temporary drains…shall not be considered implants.” (Chunk 629) |

The NY ABC CAID Psychological Testing Request Form is the official authorization request for formal psychological testing under Anthem’s New York Medicaid and Medicare Advantage programs. The policy makes it clear that formal testing is *not* covered for routine screening or for the administration of brief behavior rating scales and inventories; those tools are considered part of a routine diagnostic assessment. Formal testing is only authorized in “exceptional cases” after a diagnostic interview and relevant rating scales have been completed by a psychologist. Requests for placement, forensic, or educational testing are explicitly excluded. The form requires a completed clinical assessment, documentation of presenting symptoms, treatment history, rating scales administered, and supporting medical records. Submissions must be made electronically via Availity.com or faxed to the program‑specific numbers (Medicaid 844‑452‑8072; Medicare Advantage 844‑430‑1703).  

> *“Formal psychological testing is neither clinically indicated for routine screening or assessment of behavioral health disorders nor indicated for the administration of brief behavior rating scales and inventories… Other than in exceptional cases, a diagnostic interview and relevant rating scales should be completed by the psychologist prior to submission of requests for psychological testing authorization.”*  
> (NY_ABC_CAID_PsychologicalTestingRequestForm.pdf, page 1)  

> *“Requests for placement purposes and forensic purposes are not covered benefits. Requests for educational testing or learning disabilities assessment for educational purposes should be referred to the public school system.”*  
> (NY_ABC_CAID_PsychologicalTestingRequestForm.pdf, page 1)  

> *“Please attach any relevant medical records and/or clinical diagnostic assessment to support the request for testing.”*

**Key Points**

- **Coverage limits** – Formal psychological testing is only covered in exceptional cases after a diagnostic interview and rating scales; routine screening or brief rating scales are not covered.  
- **Exclusions** – Placement, forensic, and educational testing requests are not covered benefits.  
- **Authorization requirements** – Must include a completed clinical assessment (brief inventories, interviews, medical evaluation, etc.), documented symptoms, treatment history, rating scales administered, and supporting medical records.  
- **Submission** – Must be submitted electronically via Availity.com or faxed to the designated Medicaid (844‑452‑8072) or Medicare Advantage (844‑430‑1703) numbers.

Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield’s New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy G‑06057, last approved 11/04/2024) governs the payment of services related to abortion (termination of pregnancy). The policy states that “Anthem allows reimbursement of induced abortions unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.” Reimbursement is determined by the applicable fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate. The policy clarifies that informed consent is not required for the treatment of incomplete, missed, or septic abortions, which are considered medical‑necessity procedures rather than elective abortions.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Induced (elective) abortions are reimbursable unless overridden by external contracts or regulations.  
- **Medical‑necessity exceptions** – Incomplete, missed, and septic abortions are covered as medically necessary and do not require informed consent.  
- **Reimbursement basis** – Payment follows the fee schedule or negotiated rate; standard CPT/HCPCS coding must be used.  
- **Authorization** – Not specified in the document.  
- **Exclusions** – No explicit exclusions listed; coverage is subject to any overriding provider, state, federal, or CMS requirements.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Assistant at Surgery” policy (Policy G‑06005) governs reimbursement for a single assistant surgeon when eligible procedures are billed with modifiers 80, 81, 82, or AS.  The policy applies to all Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP providers in New York, regardless of participation status.  Reimbursement is calculated as a percentage of the primary surgeon’s allowable fee: 20 % for modifiers 80, 82, and AS; 16 % for modifier 81.  Claims must include the correct modifier and the assistant’s procedure code must match the primary surgeon’s code (unless a global code is billed).  Failure to meet these coding requirements may result in denial or adjustment of payment.

**Key Points**

- **Eligible Modifier Use** – Reimbursement is available only when the assistant’s claim includes modifier 80, 81, 82, or AS; otherwise the claim may be denied.  
- **Reimbursement Rate** – 20 % of the primary surgeon’s allowable fee for modifiers 80, 82, AS; 16 % for modifier 81.  
- **Single Assistant per Procedure** – Only one assistant surgeon may be reimbursed per eligible procedure; if multiple procedures are performed, assistant‑at‑surgery reimbursement applies only to the procedures that qualify.  
- **Procedure Code Matching** – The assistant must bill the same procedure code as the primary surgeon (unless the primary surgeon bills a global code, in which case the assistant bills the specific surgery code with the modifier).  
- **Authorization & Medical Necessity** – Services must meet state, federal, and CMS authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines; otherwise the claim may be denied.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Claims Requiring Additional Documentation” policy (Policy # G‑06031) applies to all Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP Medicaid claims in New York.  It requires providers to submit supplemental documentation for certain types of claims—such as those with unlisted or miscellaneous codes, services needing clinical review, or services that may conflict with covered benefits—before the claim can be adjudicated.  Failure to provide the requested documentation can result in claim denial, recovery of previously paid amounts, or adjustment of reimbursement.  The policy is effective 2 June 2022 and supersedes earlier versions.

> “Anthem requires professional and facility providers to submit additional documentation for adjudication of applicable types of claims. If the required documentation is not submitted, the claim may be denied.”  
> (NY_ABC_CAID_RP_ClaimsRequiringAdditionalDocumentation.pdf, p. 2)

> “If documentation is not provided following the request or notification, we may: • Deny the claim as the provider failed to provide required prepayment documentation. • Recover and/or recoup monies previously paid on the claim as the provider failed to provide required documentation for post‑payment review.”  
> (NY_ABC_CAID_RP_ClaimsRequiringAdditionalDocumentation.pdf, p. 3)

**Key Points**

- **Applicable Claims** – Claims with unlisted/miscellaneous codes, services requiring clinical review, or services that may conflict with covered benefits after member validity review.  
- **Documentation Requirements** – Providers must submit additional documentation when requested; itemized bills for DMEPOS, Home Health, and Rehabilitation Therapies must include the appropriate revenue code for each charge.  
- **Consequences of Non‑Compliance** – Claims may be denied, and previously paid amounts may be recovered or recouped; Anthem is not liable for interest or penalties in such cases.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The NY ABC CAID RP Claims Timely Filing policy (Policy No. G‑06050) establishes the time limits within which Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (NY) will consider a Medicaid claim for reimbursement.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and facilities and is governed by federal, state, and Anthem‑specific mandates.  Claims must be submitted within the specified limits to be accepted; otherwise they will be denied unless the provider can demonstrate that a clean claim was filed within the applicable period.  The policy also allows temporary waivers of the filing limits in the event of natural disasters or under state guidance.  

> “Anthem will consider reimbursement for the initial claim, when received and accepted within timely filing requirements, in compliance with federal, and/or state mandates.”  
> “Anthem follows the standard of: 90 days for participating providers and facilities; 15 months for non‑participating providers and facilities.”  
> “Claims filed beyond federal, state‑mandated, or Anthem standard timely filing limits will be denied as outside the timely filing limit.”  

**Key Points**

- **Timely‑filing windows**  
  - 90 days for participating providers/facilities.  
  - 15 months for non‑participating providers/facilities.  
- **Calculation method** – subtract the date of service from the date Anthem receives the claim; compare the number of calendar days to the applicable mandate.  For consecutive‑day services (e.g., hospital stays) the limit starts on the last day of service.  
- **Denial of late claims** – claims submitted after the applicable limit are denied unless the provider can prove a clean claim was filed within the limit.  
- **Waivers** – Anthem may temporarily waive filing limits during documented natural disasters or per state guidance.  
- **Coding requirement** – claims must use correct CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes fully supported by the medical record; otherwise the claim may be rejected, denied, or adjusted.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “NY ABC CAID RP Code and Clinical Editing Guidelines” (Policy # G‑07016) is a Medicaid reimbursement policy issued by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield for the State of New York.  Its purpose is to provide a framework for accurate claim submission and to define the basis for reimbursement when a service is covered under a member’s benefit plan.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities and requires that all services be billed with CPT®, HCPCS®, or revenue codes that are fully supported in the medical record.  Anthem applies its Code and Clinical Editing Guidelines (CCEG) to evaluate claims for accuracy and adherence to national industry standards, unless overridden by provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts.  Failure to meet these requirements may result in claim rejection, denial, recovery, or adjustment.  The policy is effective 25 March 2025 and may be superseded by higher‑level mandates; updates are posted on the Anthem provider website.

**Key Points**

- **Coding & Documentation** – All services must be billed with CPT®, HCPCS®, or revenue codes that are fully supported in the medical record and office notes.  
- **CCEG Application** – Anthem’s Code and Clinical Editing Guidelines are used to assess claim accuracy and adherence to national standards unless overridden by higher‑level contracts or mandates.  
- **Enforcement Actions** – Non‑compliance can lead to claim rejection, denial, recovery of payment, or adjustment of reimbursement.  
- **Policy Updates** – The policy may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates; updates are posted online and may retroactively affect claims.  
- **Effective Date** – 25 March 2025 (last approval date 25 March 2025).

The NY ABC CAID RP Consultations policy defines when a medical consultation is considered medically necessary and reimbursable under Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield New York for the Child and Adolescent Insurance Program (CAID).  It specifies the circumstances in which a primary‑care provider (PCP) may perform a consultation, the required CPT codes and modifiers, and the services that are explicitly non‑reimbursable.  The policy also references standard coding practices and modifier usage (e.g., Modifiers 25, 56, 55, 57) and notes that certain services are treated as evaluations rather than consultations.

> *“Consultation by a Primary Care Physician (PCP)…A surgeon has specifically requested the PCP to perform either a preoperative clearance or a postoperative evaluation, as long as…Consultation, preoperative clearance, and/or postoperative evaluation guidelines are met.”*  
> *“Nonreimbursable…Performed by telephone (Note: telephone calls are not considered telemedicine)…Performed as a split or shared E/M visit…Performed for noncovered services…For both preoperative clearance and postoperative evaluation of the same member by the same consulting provider.”*

### Key Points

| # | Coverage Criteria / Requirement | Exclusions / Limitations |
|---|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Consultation must be performed by a specialist** (not the PCP) unless the PCP is specifically requested by a surgeon for pre‑operative clearance or a postoperative evaluation, or by a behavioral‑health provider for a medical evaluation on an inpatient psychiatric unit. | PCP‑performed services are usually considered *evaluations* rather than consultations unless the above conditions are met. |
| 2 | **CPT coding** – Use the appropriate consultation code with **Modifier 56** for pre‑operative clearance or **Modifier 55** for postoperative evaluation when billed with the surgical procedure code. | If the PCP is reimbursed for a service normally included in the global surgical fee, a medical review may be required. |
| 3 | **Non‑reimbursable services** include: telephone calls, split/shared E/M visits, same‑provider same‑member visits unless Modifier 25 is used, second/third opinions requested by the member, non‑covered services, transfer of care to the consulting provider, and both pre‑operative and postoperative evaluations by the same consulting provider. | All non‑reimbursable services must meet the guidelines; otherwise, the claim will be denied. |
| 4 | **Modifiers** – Modifiers 25 (significant, separately identifiable E/M service) and 57 (split‑care surgical) are required where applicable. | Incorrect modifier usage can result in claim denial or payment adjustment. |

| **Consultation Definition** | Evaluation and management of a specific problem by a specialist requested by another provider. | CPT codes for consultation (e.g., 99241‑99245) | Must meet AMA CPT 2023 guidelines. |
| **PCP‑Performed Consultation** | Allowed only when specifically requested by a surgeon (pre‑op clearance or post‑op evaluation) or BH provider (medical evaluation for inpatient psychiatric unit). | Use Modifier 56 (pre‑op) or 55 (post‑op) with surgical code. | PCP services are otherwise considered evaluations. |
| **Non‑Reimbursable Services** | Telephone, split/shared E/M, same‑provider same‑member (unless Modifier 25), second/third opinions, non‑covered services, transfer of care, dual pre‑op/post‑op by same provider, guideline violations. | Standard CPT coding applies; no modifiers. | Claims for these services will be denied. |
| **Modifiers** | 25 – Significant, separately identifiable E/M service; 57 – Split‑care surgical; 56/55 – Pre‑op/Post‑op clearance. | Must be attached to the correct CPT code. | Incorrect modifier usage leads to payment loss. |
| **Coding Standards** | Standard correct coding applies; consult AMA CPT 2023, CMS, Optum EncoderPro 2023, State contract, State Medicaid. | Use appropriate CPT and HCPCS codes. | Adherence to coding standards is mandatory. |

The NY ABC CAID RP Corrected Claims policy (Policy # G‑16001) governs the reimbursement of corrected claims for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP Medicaid members in New York.  Reimbursement is available only when the corrected claim is submitted within the timely‑filing period that applies to the original claim, and when the claim is properly identified as a corrected claim.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and facilities.  It also allows temporary waivers of the filing deadline in the event of a documented natural disaster or under state‑mandated guidance.

**Key Points**

- **Timely‑filing requirement** – Corrected claims must be received within **60 days from the date of payment** (Explanation of Payment/Remittance Advice) for both participating and non‑participating providers.  
- **Identification** – Paper claims must be clearly marked “Corrected Claim”; electronic claims must include the applicable frequency code.  Failure to mark the claim appropriately may result in denial as a duplicate.  
- **Denial for late filing** – Claims filed beyond the 60‑day limit (or any federal, state‑mandated, or company standard limit) are denied and are not reimbursable unless documentation proves the claim was filed within the applicable limit.  
- **Batch submissions prohibited** – Corrected claims must be submitted **separately for each member and episode of care**; batch, bulk, or packaged submissions are not accepted.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy G‑06053) governs the use of durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, and orthotics that are new, rented, or used.  Anthem reimburses these items only when the appropriate modifier—**NU** (new), **RR** (rented), or **UE** (used)—is placed in the primary or first modifier field.  Claims lacking the correct modifier, or for supplies incorrectly marked with these modifiers, may be denied.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and requires that all services meet authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines.

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for new, rented, or used equipment appended with the appropriate modifier unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise…The listed modifiers are considered reimbursement modifiers and must be billed in the primary or first modifier field to determine appropriate reimbursement.”  
> “Claims for supplies appended with Modifier NU, RR, or UE may be denied.”

**Key Points**

- **Modifiers & Coverage**  
  - **NU** – new equipment  
  - **RR** – rented equipment  
  - **UE** – used equipment  
  These modifiers are required for DME, prosthetics, and orthotics; they are *not* appropriate for supplies.

- **Billing & Submission**  
  - Use the modifier in the primary/first modifier field.  
  - Claims without the correct modifier may be denied.  
  - All codes (CPT, HCPCS, revenue) must be fully supported in the medical record.

- **Exclusions & Denials**  
  - Supplies marked with NU, RR, or UE are denied.  
  - Claims for equipment lacking the appropriate modifier are denied.  
  - Services must still meet authorization and medical‑necessity criteria.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The NY ABC CAID RP DRG Inpatient Facility Transfers policy (Policy G‑13002) governs reimbursement when a member is admitted to one acute‑care facility and then transferred to a second acute‑care facility for the same episode of care.  Anthem will pay the sending facility a per‑diem amount that does not exceed what would have been paid had the member not been discharged, and the receiving facility will receive the full DRG payment for the episode.  The policy applies unless overridden by a provider, state, federal, or CMS contract.  Proper discharge‑status coding on the transferring claim is required to document the transfer.

> “Anthem allows payment for services rendered by both the sending and the receiving facility when a member is admitted to one acute care facility and subsequently transferred to another acute care facility for same episode of care unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Transferring facility will receive a calculated per diem rate based on length of stay not to exceed the amount that would have been paid if the member had not been discharged to another setting.”  
> “Receiving facility will receive full DRG payment.”  
> “The appropriate discharge status code must be used on the transferring claim to indicate that the member was transferred from one acute care facility to another acute care facility.”

**Key Points**

- **Dual‑facility payment** – Both the sending and receiving acute‑care facilities are reimbursed; the sending facility receives a per‑diem rate capped at the non‑transfer amount, while the receiving facility receives the full DRG payment.  
- **Discharge‑status coding** – The transferring claim must include the correct discharge status code that indicates a transfer between acute‑care facilities; failure to code properly can result in claim denial or adjustment.  
- **Applicability** – The policy applies unless a specific provider, state, federal, or CMS contract states otherwise; standard CPT/HCPCS coding and documentation requirements must be met.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “DRG Newborn Inpatient Stays” policy (Policy # G‑17001) governs reimbursement for newborn inpatient admissions in New York under Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP.  Effective 08/12/2020 and last approved 11/17/2023, the policy states:  

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for newborn inpatient stays unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  

Reimbursement is **Diagnosis‑Related Group (DRG)‑based** and requires that the claim be coded with the appropriate revenue code that matches the DRG.  If a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) revenue code is missing, the claim will not group to a sick‑newborn DRG.  Normal and sick‑baby DRGs are billed with their respective well‑baby or sick‑baby revenue codes.  Current authorization guidelines for normal and sick‑baby inpatient stays apply.  

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Newborn inpatient stays are reimbursed on a DRG basis; reimbursement is contingent on correct revenue‑code assignment.  
- **Revenue‑Code Requirement** – A NICU revenue code must be present for sick‑baby DRGs; absence of this code prevents grouping to a sick‑newborn DRG.  
- **Billing & Authorization** – Claims must use industry‑standard CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes, be medically necessary, and meet state‑specific authorization guidelines.  Failure to follow coding or billing guidelines may result in claim denial, adjustment, or recovery.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The NY ABC CAID reimbursement policy (Policy G‑15001) governs the use of modifiers 59, XE, XP, XS, and XU (“X{EPSU}”) for distinct procedural services performed on the same day by the same provider.  The policy applies to all Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP Medicaid members in New York and is intended to clarify when a service may be reimbursed as independent from other services, subject to CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Procedure‑to‑Procedure (PTP) edits, authorization, and medical‑necessity requirements.  Claims must be coded with CPT/HCPCS revenue codes and fully supported in the medical record.  The policy also outlines the post‑payment review process and documentation requirements for claims submitted with these modifiers.  

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for a procedure or service that is distinct or independent from other service(s) performed on the same day by the same provider when billed with Modifier 59, XE, XP, XS, or XU (collectively known as X{EPSU}) unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Anthem follows CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Procedure to Procedure (PTP) edit guidelines.”  
> “Anthem reserves the right to perform post‑payment review of claims submitted with Modifier 59 and X{EPSU}.”  

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Eligibility** – Services billed with modifiers 59, XE, XP, XS, or XU are reimbursable when they meet NCCI PTP Column 1/Column 2 edits and are distinct from other services performed on the same day.  
- **Modifier Use Guidance** – Modifier 59 may only be used if no more descriptive modifier (XE, XP, XS, XU) is available, and it cannot appear on the same claim line as any X{EPSU} modifier.  
- **Documentation & Post‑Payment Review** – Providers must supply medical records or other documentation to support the distinct service. Failure to provide required documentation after a request can result in claim denial or recoupment of previously paid amounts.

The document “Documentation Standards for Episodes of Care” (Policy # G‑11004) establishes the minimum documentation requirements that providers must meet for all episodes of care submitted to Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP for New York Medicaid.  The purpose is to ensure that claims are supported by complete, legible, and timely medical records that reflect all aspects of care and meet medical‑necessity and authorization guidelines.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities.  

**Key Points**  

- **Legibility & Completeness** – Documentation must be legible to a third party, complete, dated, and timed, and must include all aspects of care.  
- **Author Identification & Timing** – Each entry must identify the author (hand‑written signature, unique electronic identifier, or initials with credentials) and be entered at the time of service or within 30 days of the service date.  
- **Member Identification** – Member identifying information must appear on every page of the medical record.  
- **Minimum Elements** – The record must contain, at a minimum, member info, consent forms, health history, physical exam, physician orders, medications, emergency care, smoking/alcohol/substance use history, face‑to‑face evaluations, progress notes, referrals, consultation reports, laboratory reports, surgical reports, admission/discharge dates, preventive services, imaging reports, evidence of care coordination, working diagnoses, and treatment plans.

The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy No. G‑19001, effective 08/06/2024) governs the payment of drug‑screening services performed under Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP.  The policy permits reimbursement for both presumptive (qualitative) and definitive (quantitative) drug testing when the tests are properly ordered and medically necessary.  Separate payment for definitive testing is allowed only when the test is performed on the same date of service as presumptive testing and covers **one to seven drug classes**; definitive testing for **eight or more drug classes** requires a subsequent provider order and is **not separately reimbursed** on the same date.  Specimen‑validity testing is **non‑reimbursable** as a separate service—its cost is bundled into the presumptive or definitive CPT/HCPCS codes, and no modifier can override this bundle.  Documentation must show that the definitive test was ordered based on the presumptive result (confirmatory) or that it was properly ordered for specific substances not detected by presumptive methods.

The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy # G‑06032, effective 04/11/2022, last approved 05/22/2024) governs the payment of duplicate or subsequent services performed on the same date of service.  Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield allows reimbursement only when the claim is coded with the appropriate modifier(s) that identify the service as a duplicate or subsequent procedure.  Claims lacking the correct modifier(s) are denied, and unbundled services billed on the same claim are automatically denied through code editing.  Separate claims for unbundled services are reviewed on a case‑by‑case basis.  The policy applies to all participating and non‑participating providers and facilities under the NY Medicaid program.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier‑Based Reimbursement** – Duplicate or subsequent services are reimbursed only when billed with the correct modifier(s) listed in the “Related Coding” section (e.g., 25, 59, 62, 66, 76, 77, 80, 81, 82, 91, AS, GG, GH, XE, XP, XS, XU).  
- **Denial for Missing Modifiers** – Claims for services deemed duplicate or subsequent without the appropriate modifier(s) are denied, whether the services appear on the same or separate claims.  
- **Bundled‑Service Rules** – If a service is unbundled from a more comprehensive service and billed individually on the same date:  
  - The line is denied via code editing if billed on the same claim.  
  - The claim is reviewed if billed on separate claims.

The New York Medicaid “Emergency Department Leveling of Evaluation and Management Services” policy (Policy # G‑19002) governs how Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP reimburses facility‑based emergency department (ED) encounters.  Effective 01/16/2024, the policy requires that the ED E/M code level billed reflect the intensity and complexity of resources and interventions used during the encounter.  If the billed level exceeds the level supported by the claim, Anthem may deny, adjust, or recover payment.  The policy lists specific exclusions (e.g., critical‑care or outpatient surgery performed in the ED, member death, inpatient admission, observation status) and notes that it follows EMTALA and other federal/state regulations.

**Key Points**

- **Leveling Requirement** – The ED E/M code level must match the intensity/complexity of interventions and resources documented; otherwise the claim may be denied, adjusted, or recovered.  
- **Exclusions** – Claims for critical‑care/outpatient surgery in the ED, member death, inpatient admission or transfer, and observation status are excluded from reimbursement.  
- **Authorization & Medical Necessity** – Not explicitly required in the policy; claims must still meet general authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines applicable to the member’s plan.  
- **Coding Standards** – Use of current CPT, HCPCS, and revenue codes is mandatory; documentation must support the billed level.  
- **Policy Supersession** – The policy may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates; Anthem reserves the right to recoup payments if the policy is delayed.

The New York Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) policy (Policy # G‑06049) governs the reimbursement of preventive services for children and pregnant women.  Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP will pay for EPSDT services “unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise”【1†L1-L4】.  Reimbursement is based on the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rate【1†L5-L6】.  The policy lists the preventive‑medicine E/M visit and a set of component services that are either bundled with the E/M visit or reimbursed separately, and it specifies the required billing elements, modifiers, and coding standards.  Claims must include the EPSDT special‑program indicator, appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes, and Modifier EP for all EPSDT component services【1†L20-L30】【1†L40-L48】.  Services performed on the same day as a sick visit are subject to the Preventive Medicine and Sick Visits on Same Day policy【1†L32-L34】.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Scope** – All EPSDT preventive services are reimbursable unless overridden by higher‑level mandates; reimbursement follows the fee schedule or negotiated rate【1†L5-L6】.  
- **Component Services** – The preventive‑medicine E/M visit includes comprehensive history, physical exam, health education, nutrition assessment, and dental screening; developmental, hearing, immunization, urinalysis, vision, and laboratory tests (e.g., newborn metabolic, TB, lead, cholesterol, Pap, STD) are reimbursed separately with Modifier EP【1†L20-L30】【1†L32-L38】.  
- **Billing & Coding Requirements** – Claims must contain the EPSDT special‑program indicator, referral indicator codes (if applicable), diagnosis codes, HCPCS codes for completed EPSDT services, appropriate E/M codes, procedure codes for component services, and Modifier EP【1†L40-L48】.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Eligible Billed Charges” policy (Policy # G‑06001) governs reimbursement for Medicaid services in New York under Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield.  It establishes that a billed charge is reimbursable only when the member and provider meet program eligibility, the service is covered by the member’s benefit plan, and all authorization, clinical, administrative, and coding requirements are satisfied.  The allowed amount is the fee‑schedule or negotiated rate after applying coinsurance, copayments, deductibles, and coordination of benefits.  The policy explicitly excludes reimbursement for items the provider receives or provides free of charge and requires standard CPT/HCPCS coding.  

**Key Points**  
- **Eligibility Criteria** – Member program eligibility, provider program eligibility, benefit coverage, authorization, provider manual guidelines, administrative and clinical policies, and code‑editing logic must all be met.  
- **Allowed Amount** – Determined by the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate, then reduced by coinsurance, copayments, deductibles, and coordination of benefits.  
- **Exclusions** – No reimbursement for items the provider receives free of charge or provides free of charge to the member.  
- **Coding** – Standard correct coding (CPT®, HCPCS®, revenue codes) is mandatory; any deviation may trigger claim denial or adjustment.  
- **Terminology** – In the absence of contrary language, terms such as “billed charges,” “covered charges,” “allowed charges,” and “percent of charge” default to eligible charges.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP’s New York Medicaid policy G‑06081 (effective 05/22/2024) governs reimbursement for durable medical equipment (DME) and medical supplies that are taken home by a member after a hospital stay.  The policy explicitly **denies reimbursement for any DME or supplies that are dispensed by an inpatient or outpatient facility and billed with revenue codes indicating take‑home use** unless a separate contract or federal/CMS requirement overrides this rule.  Reimbursement is only available when the item is supplied by a **vendor** (participating or non‑participating) and billed with the appropriate revenue codes.  The policy lists two narrow exceptions for supplies dispensed at discharge: crutches and up to 72 hours of supplies when a vendor could not be obtained.

**Key Points**

- **Facility‑issued take‑home DME/supplies are denied** – “Anthem does not allow reimbursement of durable medical equipment (DME) and medical supplies dispensed by inpatient or outpatient hospital facilities for take‑home use unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise”【source】.  
- **Vendor‑supplied DME/supplies are reimbursable** – claims must be submitted by a DME/supply vendor and are paid at the contract or negotiated rate for participating vendors or the out‑of‑network fee schedule for non‑participating vendors【source】.  
- **Limited discharge exceptions** – “Anthem allows reimbursement of facility claims for medical supplies dispensed to the member at discharge and billed with revenue codes other than take‑home for the following items: • Crutches • No more than 72 hours of medical supplies if the provider was not able to obtain supplies from a vendor by discharge”【source】.  
- **Correct coding is mandatory** – “Standard correct coding applies” and “claims for take‑home DME and medical supplies billed with revenue codes denoting take‑home use will be denied”【source】.  
- **Authorization & medical‑necessity requirements** – “Services must meet authorization and medical necessity guidelines appropriate to the procedure and diagnosis”【source】.  
- **Non‑compliance consequences** – “If appropriate coding/billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, Anthem may: • Reject or deny the claim • Recover and/or recoup claim payment • Adjust the reimbursement”【source】.

The New York Medicaid “Global Surgical Package for Professional Providers” (Policy No. — effective 04/21/20) establishes the reimbursement framework for all surgical procedures performed by professional providers under Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP.  The policy follows CMS global‑surgery values and applies to both minor and major surgeries with postoperative periods of 0, 10, or 90 days, in any setting.  It defines what is included in the global package, what is excluded and separately reimbursable, and the coding and modifier requirements for claims.  The policy is intended to guide accurate claim submission and to outline the basis for reimbursement, subject to authorization and medical‑necessity criteria.

**Key Points**

- **Included in the Global Package** – Pre‑operative services after the decision to operate, intra‑operative services, and post‑operative care within the defined postoperative period (0, 10, 90 days).  
- **Separately Reimbursable Services** – Initial surgeon consultation, services by other physicians (unless a transfer‑of‑care agreement exists), unrelated post‑operative visits, treatment of underlying conditions, diagnostic tests, distinct surgical procedures during the postoperative period, treatment of complications requiring return to the OR, second procedures after a failed less‑extensive procedure, immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, and unrelated critical‑care services.  
- **Modifier Requirements** – Providers must attach HIPAA‑compliant modifiers (e.g., 24, 25, 57, 78) to any services performed during the postoperative period to indicate unrelated or additional services.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy G‑06164) governs the payment for medically‑necessary, nonelective hysterectomy procedures performed on covered members.  The policy applies to all participating and non‑participating providers and facilities in New York and requires that the procedure be supported by a valid, state‑approved Consent/Acknowledgement of Hysterectomy form and that the member’s informed consent be documented.  Reimbursement is based on the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rate and is contingent upon meeting the medical‑necessity criteria and the documentation requirements outlined in the policy.  

**Key Points**  
- **Medical Necessity & Consent** – A hysterectomy is reimbursable only if it is medically necessary to treat an illness or injury, the member has given informed consent, and the member (or authorized representative) acknowledges that the procedure will permanently render the member incapable of reproduction.  
- **Consent/Acknowledgement Form** – A state‑approved Consent/Acknowledgement of Hysterectomy form must be signed by the member (unless exempted), the person obtaining consent, and the performing physician.  Claims lacking a valid form may be rejected or denied.  
- **Non‑Reimbursable Situations** – The policy explicitly excludes reimbursement for hysterectomies performed solely to render a member sterile, for cancer prophylaxis, or when the primary purpose is to render the member permanently incapable of reproduction.  
- **Emergency Exceptions** – If the hysterectomy is performed in a life‑threatening emergency where prior consent is not possible, the physician’s certification on the form is required, but the member’s informed consent is not.  
- **Multiple Surgery Modifiers** – When a hysterectomy is performed concurrently with a delivery, the standard Multiple/Bilateral Surgery modifiers (50/51) apply.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Maternity Services” policy (G‑14001) governs reimbursement for obstetric care under Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP.  Effective 07/07/2023, it allows a single global obstetric code to be paid once per pregnancy (defined as a 279‑day period) **only when the entire antepartum‑delivery‑postpartum package is provided by the same provider or provider group reporting under one federal TIN**.  If any component of the package is missing, the global code cannot be used and only the specific services rendered may be billed.  The policy prohibits duplicate or overlapping services, and it specifies that claims for global, delivery‑only, or delivery/post‑partum services that have already been paid may be denied or recouped.  Delivery‑only services are reimbursed only to assistant surgeons for cesarean deliveries when the appropriate modifier is appended.  Providers must use the correct E/M codes for antepartum/postpartum visits, attach the appropriate diagnosis codes indicating delivery outcome and gestational weeks, and meet all authorization and medical‑necessity requirements.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Global obstetric code** – reimbursed once per pregnancy (279 days) only if the full antepartum‑delivery‑postpartum package is delivered by the same TIN; otherwise, only the individual services may be billed.  
- **Duplicate/overlap** – no reimbursement for duplicate or overlapping services; claims for global, delivery‑only, or delivery/post‑partum services already paid may be denied or recouped.  
- **Delivery‑only** – reimbursed only to assistant surgeons for cesarean deliveries when the correct modifier is used; otherwise denied.  
- **Coding & documentation** – use appropriate E/M codes for antepartum/postpartum care; attach diagnosis codes for delivery outcome and gestational weeks on all delivery claims; failure to provide these codes results in denial.  
- **Authorization & medical necessity** – all services must meet state‑specific authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines; claims must be coded with CPT/HCPCS and supported by the medical record.

The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP policy “Maximum Units Per Day” (Policy # G‑15003) establishes the upper limit of reimbursable units for any procedure or service billed for a single member on a single date of service by the same provider or provider group. The policy applies to all Anthem‑covered services, regardless of provider participation status, and is effective from 06/16/2021 with the most recent approval on 12/19/2023. Units billed beyond the daily maximum are not reimbursable unless the provider supplies documentation that justifies the excess. The policy does not alter National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits.

**Key Points**

- **Maximum Units** – Each procedure/service has a defined daily unit cap; units above this cap are denied unless documented otherwise.  
- **Documentation for Excess Units** – If a provider bills units exceeding the cap, the medical record must contain documentation that supports reimbursement for the excess units.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield of New York’s “Medical Recalls” policy (Policy # G‑06111, effective 05/22/2024) governs reimbursement for items and procedures that arise from a medical recall.  The policy applies to durable medical equipment, supplies, prosthetics, orthotics, drugs/vaccines, and implantable devices.  In general, Anthem does **not** reimburse for repair or replacement of recalled items unless a state, federal, CMS contract, or other requirement specifically allows it.  Reimbursement is limited to **medically necessary procedures** that remove or replace a recalled device; payment is reduced by any device credit already received by the facility.  Anthem reserves the right to recoup or recover fees from manufacturers, distributors, or providers when it has paid for recall‑related services.

**Key Points**

- **No repair/replacement reimbursement** – “Anthem does not allow reimbursement for repair or replacement of items due to a medical recall unless provider, state, federal, CMS contracts, and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
- **Procedures reimbursed** – “Anthem will allow reimbursement of medically necessary procedures to remove and replace recalled or replaced devices.”  Payment is reduced by the amount of any device credit the facility has received.  
- **Recoupment rights** – Anthem may recover fees from manufacturers/distributors or from the provider if it has paid for recall‑related services or device credits.  
- **Coding requirements** – Providers must bill the appropriate condition code, value code, modifier, and/or diagnosis code to identify a medically recalled item.  
- **Authorization & medical‑necessity** – All services must meet the usual authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines for the member’s plan and state of residence.

The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York policy (G‑15004) governs the use of **Modifier 26 (Professional Component)** and **Modifier TC (Technical Component)** for global procedures or services.  The policy states that both components may be reimbursed when the appropriate modifier is appended, *unless* a state, federal, or CMS contract overrides this rule.  Reimbursement is based on the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rate, the physician’s specialty, and the place of service.  The policy clarifies that the technical component is reimbursed only by the facility; a physician may bill only the professional component and must arrange separate reimbursement for any technical work performed in a facility setting.  The policy also defines which places of service are considered “facility” locations where the technical component is not reimbursed to a physician.

- **Modifier 26** – Used to bill the *professional* component of a global procedure.  The physician may bill this component in any place of service, but the technical component must be billed separately by the facility.  
- **Modifier TC** – Used to bill the *technical* component of a global procedure.  This component is reimbursed only by the facility; a physician cannot bill for it in any facility place of service.  
- **Place‑of‑Service Restrictions** – The policy lists specific place‑of‑service codes (e.g., 19, 21‑24, 51, 61) that are considered “facility” locations where the technical component is not reimbursed to a physician.  
- **Reimbursement Basis** – Payments are determined by the fee schedule or negotiated rate, the provider’s specialty, and the place of service code.  
- **Contractual Overrides** – Any state, federal, or CMS contract that conflicts with this policy takes precedence; the policy may be superseded by such mandates.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy # G‑07020) governs the use of CPT/HCPCS **Modifier 22** (“increased procedural services”).  Effective 09/06/2024, Anthem reimburses 100 % of the applicable fee‑schedule or contracted rate for any procedure code that is billed with Modifier 22 **provided** the service is “substantially more extensive” than the routine service described by the code.  Modifier 22 is permitted only for surgical procedures that have a global period of 000, 010, 090, or YYY and **cannot** be appended to evaluation‑and‑management (E/M) services.  Claims must follow standard coding guidelines and meet all authorization/medical‑necessity requirements; failure to do so may result in denial or adjustment.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Modifier 22 is allowed for procedure codes with global periods 000, 010, 090, or YYY; reimbursement equals 100 % of the fee schedule or contracted rate.  
- **Use Criteria** – Modifier 22 may be billed only when the service performed is *substantially more extensive* than the routine service in the base code and **not** for E/M services.  
- **Compliance** – Claims must use correct CPT/HCPCS codes, include supporting documentation, and meet authorization/medical‑necessity guidelines; otherwise Anthem may reject, deny, or adjust the claim.  
- **Applicability** – The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities.  
- **Effective Date** – 09/06/2024 (last approval 09/06/2024).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy G‑06027 (Effective 08/07/2020, last approved 03/15/2023) governs the use of **Modifier 62** for co‑surgeon services.  The policy allows reimbursement when two surgeons of *different specialties* perform distinct parts of the same operative procedure during a single surgical session.  Each surgeon is reimbursed at **62.5 %** of the applicable fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate.  Both surgeons must bill the same procedure code(s) with Modifier 62; failure to do so can result in one surgeon receiving 100 % of the fee schedule while the other’s claim may be denied or pended.  Assistant‑surgeon rules (Modifiers 80/82) and multiple‑procedure fee reductions apply only when the co‑surgeon acts as an assistant or additional procedures are performed.

**Key Points**

- **Eligibility** – Two primary surgeons of *different specialties* must perform distinct operative work during the same session; each must bill the same CPT/HCPCS code(s) with Modifier 62.  
- **Reimbursement** – Each surgeon receives **62.5 %** of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate.  
- **Coding Requirements** – Both surgeons must attach Modifier 62 to every procedure code (and any add‑on codes) performed together.  If one surgeon omits the modifier, the other may receive 100 % of the fee schedule and the omitted claim may be denied or pended.  
- **Special Conditions** – Assistant‑surgeon rules (Modifiers 80/82) and fee reductions for multiple procedures apply only when the co‑surgeon acts as an assistant or additional procedures are performed during the same session.  
- **Authorization** – Claims must meet standard medical‑necessity and authorization guidelines for the member’s benefit plan; the policy does not guarantee payment.

The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy G‑06039 (“Modifier 66”) governs reimbursement for services performed by a surgical team.  The policy permits each physician on the team to bill their individual services with Modifier 66, provided the service is otherwise eligible for surgical‑team reimbursement.  Anthem reimburses each billed procedure at **20 % of the fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate**.  Claims must include appropriate documentation and correct coding; failure to use the modifier or to provide documentation can result in denial or adjustment.  The policy also clarifies that assistant‑surgeon rules (Modifiers 80/81/82/AS) do not apply to services billed with Modifier 66.

The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy G‑06018, effective 11/07/2016, last approved 08/28/2023) governs the use of **Modifier 76** to indicate that a procedure or service was repeated by the same physician.  The policy applies to both professional and facility claims for Medicaid services provided by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP.  Reimbursement is allowed for a repeated procedure when the same physician performs it **subsequent to the original** (professional claims) or **on the same date** (facility claims).  For nonsurgical procedures, the payer reimburses 100 % of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate; for surgical procedures, 100 % is paid for the surgical component only, limited to a maximum of two surgical procedures per claim.  Professional services other than radiology must be supported by documentation and are subject to clinical review.  Claims lacking documentation or using Modifier 76 inappropriately are denied.

**Key Points**

- **Eligibility** – Modifier 76 may be used when the same physician repeats a procedure **subsequent to the original** (professional claims) or **on the same date** (facility claims).

The policy applies to both professional and facility claims and requires that the modifier be used only when the repeat is **subsequent to the original procedure for professional claims** or **on the same date for facility claims**.  Reimbursement is 100 % of the applicable fee schedule (or contracted rate) for nonsurgical services, and for surgical services 100 % of the fee schedule for the surgical component only, limited to **two surgical procedures**.  All claims with modifier 77 must be supported by documentation; otherwise the claim is denied.  The policy also specifies non‑reimbursable uses and additional fee‑reduction rules for assistant surgeons or multiple procedures.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Modifier 77 is reimbursable for a repeat procedure performed by another physician:  
  • Professional claims: subsequent to the original procedure.  
  • Facility claims: on the same date as the original procedure.  
  • 100 % of the fee schedule for nonsurgical services; 100 % for the surgical component of a surgical procedure, limited to two procedures.  

- **Documentation & Review** – Claims must include supporting documentation; otherwise they are denied.  Professional services (except radiology) are subject to clinical review.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy G‑06016) governs the use of Modifier 78 for “unplanned return to the operating or procedure room” during the postoperative period of an initial surgical procedure.  The policy applies to all Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP Medicaid services in New York and is effective 11/16/2018 (last approved 09/27/2023).  Claims billed with Modifier 78 are reimbursed only when the return to the operating room is unplanned, the same physician performs the procedure, the procedure is related to the initial surgery, and the appropriate surgical CPT/HCPCS code is used.  Reimbursement is limited to 100 % of the maximum fee schedule or contracted rate for the surgical code; pre‑ or postoperative care is not covered, and procedures performed during the postoperative period without Modifier 78 are normally denied as part of the global surgical package.  Assistant‑surgeon rules apply when an assistant surgeon is involved.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Criteria** – Claims with Modifier 78 are paid only if:  
  1. The return to the operating or procedure room is *unplanned*;  
  2. The same physician who performed the initial procedure performs the return;  
  3. The procedure is *related* to the initial surgery and performed during the postoperative period;  
  4. The correct surgical code is used.  
  *Source: “Anthem allows reimbursement for claims billed with modifier 78 when the following criteria are met…”*  

- **Payment Limits** – Reimbursement will not exceed 100 % of the maximum fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate for the surgical procedure code.  Only the surgical procedure is reimbursed; pre‑operative or post‑operative care is excluded.  
  *Source: “Reimbursement will not exceed 100% of the maximum fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate of the surgical procedure code…”*  

- **Non‑reimbursable Situations** – Modifier 78 is not reimbursed when billed with nonsurgical codes or codes that explicitly denote a subsequent, related, or redo procedure in the description.  Assistant‑surgeon rules apply if an assistant surgeon is used during the global period.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G‑20001) governs the use of Modifier 90 for laboratory services. Effective 10/01/2021 and last approved 11/30/2021, the policy explicitly prohibits pass‑through billing for lab tests performed by a third‑party laboratory when the claim is submitted with Modifier 90 in place of service (POS) 11 (Office). Instead, the laboratory that performed the test must submit the claim directly and will be reimbursed at 100 % of the applicable fee schedule or a contracted/negotiated rate. The policy does not apply to laboratory or pathology providers that are specifically authorized to bill in POS 11.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 90 Denial** – Claims that use Modifier 90 with POS 11 are denied unless a separate contract or regulatory requirement allows pass‑through billing.  
- **Direct Lab Billing** – The laboratory that performed the test must submit the claim; reimbursement is paid directly to the lab at 100 % of the fee schedule or negotiated rate.  
- **Scope of Application** – The rule applies to all providers (participating or non‑participating) except laboratory/pathology entities that are expressly permitted to bill in POS 11.  
- **Compliance Requirements** – Claims must still meet medical‑necessity and authorization guidelines and use standard CPT/HCPCS codes.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield (NY) allows reimbursement for repeat clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are billed with **Modifier 91**.  The modifier is intended to indicate that the same laboratory test was performed on the same day for the same member to obtain *multiple* results.  Reimbursement is paid at 100 % of the applicable fee‑schedule or contracted rate.  The policy requires that the use of Modifier 91 be medically justified and that documentation support the need for multiple results.  Improper use—such as repeating a test only to confirm a result, to correct a specimen or equipment error, or when another code already describes a series of results—may lead to denial of the claim as a duplicate service.  The policy is effective 17 July 2024 and applies to all participating and non‑participating providers unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.

> “Anthem allows reimbursement of claims for repeat clinical diagnostic laboratory tests appended with Modifier 91 unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Reimbursement is based on 100 % of the applicable fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate of the clinical diagnostic laboratory test billed with Modifier 91.”  
> “It is inappropriate to use Modifier 91 when only a single test result is required.”  
> “Modifier 91 may not be used in the following situations: • To repeat a test to confirm initial results; • Because there was a problem with the specimen or equipment when performing the initial test; • When other code(s) describe a series of test results.”

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Repeat laboratory tests performed on the same day for the same member and billed with Modifier 91 are reimbursed at 100 % of the fee schedule or negotiated rate.  
- **Documentation** – Medical records must support the need for multiple results; documentation may be requested by Anthem.  
- **Restrictions** – Modifier 91 cannot be used to repeat a test for confirmation, to correct specimen/equipment errors, or when another code already covers a series of results.  
- **Denial Risk** – Improper use of Modifier 91 may result in denial of the claim as a duplicate service.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Modifier Usage” policy (Policy # G‑06006, effective 01/16/2024) governs how Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP must bill for covered services when modifiers are used.  The policy states that reimbursement is contingent on the use of the correct CPT/HCPCS codes **and** the appropriate modifier in the primary modifier field.  Certain modifiers require supporting documentation, and the modifier must be in capital letters if it is alphanumeric.  Failure to meet these coding requirements may result in claim rejection, denial, or payment recovery.  Anthem reserves the right to review high‑volume modifier usage and to revise the policy when necessary.  The policy may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for covered services provided to eligible members when billed with appropriate procedure codes and appropriate modifiers when applicable, unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Certain modifiers require supporting documentation to be submitted with the claim.”  
> “If appropriate coding/billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, Anthem may: • Reject or deny the claim. • Recover and/or recoup claim payment. • Adjust the reimbursement to reflect the appropriate services and/or procedures performed.”

**Key Points**

- **Correct Modifier Placement** – Modifiers must appear in the primary/first modifier field and be in capital letters if alphanumeric.  
- **Documentation Requirement** – Some modifiers (e.g., 22, 24, 25, 57, 26, TC, 50/51, 52/53, 73/74, 62/63, 66, 76/77/78, 80/81/82/AS, 90/91, LT/RT) require supporting documentation; see the specific modifier policies for details.  
- **Consequences of Incorrect Use** – Claims lacking the correct modifier or containing an incorrect modifier may be rejected or denied, and Anthem may recover or recoup payment.  
- **Policy Supersession** – The policy may be overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts or requirements.  
- **Effective Date & Revision** – Effective 01/16/2024; the policy is subject to periodic updates and revisions.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP New York Medicaid policy **G‑06003** (Modifiers 25 & 57) governs separate reimbursement for Evaluation & Management (E/M) services performed on the day of or immediately before a surgical procedure.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and is effective 05/22/2024.  It specifies that a significant, separately identifiable E/M service may be reimbursed in addition to the global surgical package when billed with Modifier 25 (same‑day E/M) or Modifier 57 (E/M that initiates the decision to operate).  Reimbursement is 100 % of the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rate, provided that the E/M level, modifier, and documentation meet the stated criteria and that the service is medically necessary and authorized.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 25 (Same‑day E/M)** – Separate reimbursement is allowed for a major surgery (90‑day global) or minor surgery (0‑ or 10‑day global) when the E/M is billed with Modifier 25, the appropriate level is used, and the service is clearly documented as above and beyond the procedure or its usual pre‑/post‑operative care.  
- **Modifier 57 (Decision‑to‑Operate E/M)** – Separate reimbursement is allowed when an E/M service results in the initial decision to perform a major procedure on the day of or the day before the surgery.  
- **Reimbursement Basis & Documentation** – 100 % of the fee schedule or negotiated rate; requires the correct E/M level, the modifier, and clear documentation of the reason for the E/M in the medical record.  
- **Scope & Applicability** – Applies to all providers (participating or non‑participating) unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.  The policy may be superseded by other mandates and is subject to periodic updates.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The policy (G‑07022) governs the use of the informational modifiers **LT** (left) and **RT** (right) on procedure codes.  It states that when a modifier is used to indicate the side of the body for a unilateral procedure, the claim is reimbursed at **100 % of the fee schedule or negotiated rate**.  Modifiers do **not** alter payment.  They must not be attached to bilateral procedures or to codes that already contain “bilateral” or “unilateral” in the description.  If both LT and RT are billed for the same procedure, the claim is subject to the multiple‑surgery rules.  The policy applies to all participating and non‑participating providers and facilities, and requires that claims meet authorization, medical‑necessity, and proper coding guidelines.  Anthem reserves the right to reject, deny, recoup, or adjust claims that do not comply.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement** – 100 % of the fee schedule or contracted rate; modifiers are informational only.  
- **Correct use** – LT/RT may be used only for unilateral procedures; never for bilateral procedures or codes that already indicate side.  
- **Multiple‑surgery rule** – Claims with both LT and RT for the same procedure are treated as multiple surgeries.  
- **Compliance** – Claims must be authorized, medically necessary, and coded with CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes fully supported in the medical record.  
- **Enforcement** – Non‑compliant claims may be rejected, denied, recouped, or adjusted.

The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy # G‑06044) governs professional payment for multiple‑birth deliveries performed by a same‑delivery or combined‑delivery method. Effective 07/17/2024, the policy applies to all participating and non‑participating providers. It specifies that vaginal deliveries in a multiple‑birth scenario must be billed with modifier 51 (multiple procedure) and that cesarean deliveries must be billed with modifier 22 (increased procedural complexity). The policy clarifies that multiple‑procedure guidelines apply to vaginal deliveries but not to cesarean deliveries. All services must meet standard medical‑necessity and authorization requirements and be coded with appropriate CPT/HCPCS codes.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Scope** – Reimbursement is available for multiple births delivered by same‑delivery or combined‑delivery methods unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.  
- **Vaginal Deliveries** – Must be billed with modifier 51; multiple‑procedure guidelines apply.  
- **Cesarean Deliveries** – Must be billed with modifier 22; multiple‑procedure guidelines do **not** apply.  
- **Coding & Billing** – Use standard CPT/HCPCS codes; claims must be fully supported in the medical record.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G‑06010) governs the use of CPT modifiers 50 and 51 for multiple and bilateral surgical procedures.  It applies to both professional and facility claims and is effective 11/25/2020 with the latest update on 08/28/2023.  The policy states that reimbursement is allowed for multiple and bilateral surgeries unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.  Claims must be coded with the appropriate modifier and must meet medical‑necessity and authorization requirements.  Failure to use the correct modifier or to follow the fee‑schedule reduction rules can result in claim denial or payment adjustment.  

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for multiple and bilateral surgery unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Professional provider claims for applicable surgical procedures must be billed with Modifier 51 to denote a multiple procedure. Facility claims should not be billed with Modifier 51.”  
> “Bilateral surgery that uses a unilateral code should be reported on a single line with Modifier 50 for professional and facility provider claims. Reimbursement is 150 % of the fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate of the procedure.”  

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 51 (Multiple Procedure)** – Used on professional claims for each additional procedure performed on the same day/session.  Facility claims do **not** use Modifier 51.  
- **Modifier 50 (Bilateral Procedure)** – Applied to a single line when a unilateral code is used for a procedure performed on both sides of the body during the same session.  Reimbursement is 150 % of the fee schedule or contracted rate.  
- **Fee‑Schedule Reductions** –  
  - Highest‑valued procedure: 100 % of fee schedule.  
  - 2nd–5th procedures: 50 % of fee schedule.  
  - 6th and beyond: 50 % only if medically necessary per clinical review.  
- **Coding Rules** – Do not append modifiers to codes that already contain “bilateral,” “unilateral,” or are inherently bilateral.  Reimbursement for such codes is 100 % of the fee schedule.  
- **Compliance** – Claims lacking the correct modifier or violating the reduction rules may be denied, adjusted, or recovered.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Multiple Radiology Payment Reduction” policy (Policy No. G‑12002) governs professional reimbursement for diagnostic imaging services under New York Medicaid (Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield). Effective 12/10/2024, the policy applies to all professional providers and facilities, except that it does **not** affect facility reimbursement. When a provider performs more than one diagnostic imaging procedure on the same date of service and within the same patient encounter, the National Physician Fee Schedule (NPFS) multiple procedure indicator (MPI = 4) triggers a Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (MPPR). The policy specifies that the highest‑valued procedure receives 100 % of the fee schedule or contracted rate, while all subsequent procedures are reimbursed at 60 % of the fee schedule or contracted rate. The reduction does **not** apply if the procedures are reported with modifier 59 or X{EPSU} to indicate they were performed on the same day but in separate sessions, nor does it apply to a single imaging procedure that is submitted with multiple units.

**Key Points**

- **MPPR Trigger**: Multiple diagnostic imaging procedures performed by the same provider/group on the same date of service and within the same encounter are subject to MPPR (MPI = 4).  
- **Reimbursement Rates**: Highest‑valued procedure = 100 % of fee schedule/contracted rate; second and subsequent procedures = 60 % of fee schedule/contracted rate.  
- **Modifiers Exempt**: Use of modifier 59 or X{EPSU} exempts procedures from MPPR when performed on the same day but in separate sessions.  
- **Single Procedure with Multiple Units**: A single imaging procedure submitted with multiple units is also subject to MPPR.  
- **Scope**: Applies to professional reimbursement only; facility reimbursement is excluded.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield’s New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G‑20002) governs services performed by nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs).  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and requires that all services meet standard authorization and medical‑necessity criteria.  Reimbursement is available only when the service is considered a physician’s service, falls within the provider’s scope of practice, and is paid at the NP fee‑schedule rate.  Separate payment for PA services is not allowed; PA services must be billed by the supervising physician.  Drugs, durable medical equipment (DMEPOS), laboratory services, and laboratory screening tests are excluded from the payment reduction.  Claims must use proper CPT/HCPCS codes and the NP’s own NPI as the rendering provider; the supervising physician’s NPI is used for PA services.  The policy became effective 11 January 2024 and may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Criteria** – Services must be a physician’s service, within scope, and paid at the NP fee‑schedule rate; PA services are billed by the supervising physician and are not reimbursed separately.  
- **Exclusions** – Drugs, DMEPOS, laboratory services, and laboratory screening tests are not eligible for payment reduction.  
- **Billing & Coding** – Use CPT/HCPCS codes; NPs submit with their own NPI, PAs with the supervising physician’s NPI; modifiers 80‑82 and AS may apply.  
- **Authorization & Medical Necessity** – All services must meet state‑specific authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines.  
- **Claims Compliance** – Failure to follow coding or billing guidelines can result in claim denial, recovery, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield (NY) reimbursement policy G‑06160 (effective 07/23/2021, last approved 12/19/2023) governs portable, mobile, and handheld radiology services performed at a member’s residence.  Services must be ordered by a physician, performed by a licensed or registered portable radiology supplier, and meet medical‑necessity and authorization requirements.  Reimbursement is based on the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate for the radiological study plus separate transportation and setup components.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage** – Portable/mobile radiology studies are reimbursable only when performed at a member’s residence (private home, assisted‑living, nursing, or intermediate‑care facility) and are medically necessary, physician‑ordered, and performed by a qualified supplier.  
- **Transportation & Setup** – Transportation is reimbursed once per location per visit; if multiple members are served, the cost is divided by the number of members (Modifiers UN, UP, UQ, UR, US).  Setup costs are reimbursable separately.  No reimbursement for transportation of equipment stored at a qualifying residence.  
- **Modifiers** – Use modifiers UN, UP, UQ, UR, US to indicate the number of patients served and to apportion transportation costs.  No modifier is required when only one member is served.  
- **Handheld Radiology** – Both professional and technical components are reimbursable when the qualified physician performs the service in their office and owns or leases the equipment.  
- **Non‑reimbursable** – Transportation costs for equipment stored for use at a member’s residence are not reimbursed; if the diagnostic X‑ray is not covered, transportation and setup fees are also not paid.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Preventable Adverse Events” policy establishes that Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield will **not reimburse** for any Preventable Adverse Event (PAE) unless a provider, state, federal, or CMS contract specifically allows it. PAEs are divided into two categories:  
1. **Health‑Care‑Acquired Conditions (HCACs)** – hospital‑ or health‑care‑acquired diagnoses that must be flagged with a Present‑on‑Admission (POA) indicator on all inpatient claims. If an HCAC is present on admission, the episode of care may be reduced or denied.  
2. **Other Provider Preventable Conditions (OPPCs)** – surgical or invasive errors (wrong body part, wrong patient, wrong surgery) that are automatically rejected or denied for all professional and facility claims.  

The policy requires accurate POA coding, correct use of OPPC modifiers, and full medical‑record support. Claims may be subject to clinical review, and pre‑existing conditions that existed before treatment do not affect reimbursement.

---

**Key Points**

- **No Reimbursement for PAEs** – Anthem will not pay for HCACs or OPPCs unless a specific contract or regulation states otherwise.  
- **POA Indicator Requirement** – All inpatient primary and secondary diagnoses must include a POA indicator; failure to do so can result in denial or rejection.  
- **OPPC Denial** – Any procedure identified as an OPPC (wrong body part, wrong patient, wrong surgery) and its related services are automatically denied; correct coding and modifiers are mandatory.  
- **Pre‑existing Conditions** – If an HCAC or OPPC existed before the provider’s treatment, it does not impact that provider’s reimbursement.  
- **Clinical Review** – Claims may be reviewed clinically for appropriate reimbursement consideration.

**Policy Information Table**

| Coverage Category | Definition (Excerpt) | Reimbursement Status | Documentation / Coding Requirements | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| **Health‑Care‑Acquired Condition (HCAC)** | “Hospital‑acquired conditions and health care‑acquired conditions (both referred to in this document as Health Care Acquired Conditions)” | May be reduced or denied if present on admission | POA indicator required for all inpatient primary & secondary diagnoses; use CMS‑identified HCAC list (Exhibit C) | If HCAC existed prior to treatment, reimbursement is not affected. |
| **Other Provider Preventable Condition (OPPC)** | “Surgical or invasive procedure on the wrong body part / wrong patient / wrong surgery” | Automatically rejected or denied | Use appropriate ICD‑10 codes (Y65.53, Y65.52, Y65.51) and modifiers (PA, PB, PC); submit as no‑pay claim (Type of Bill 0110) for the error, separate claim for other services | Wrong‑surgery modifier (PC) must not be used for professional component; incorrect use leads to denial. |
| **Present‑on‑Admission (POA) Indicator** | “Anthem requires the identification of HCACs through the submission of a Present on Admission (POA) indicator for all diagnoses on inpatient facility claims as identified by CMS.” | Required for all inpatient primary & secondary diagnoses | Must be included on claim; not required on admitting diagnosis | Failure to include POA may result in denial or rejection. |
| **Pre‑existing Condition** | “Reimbursement will not be reduced or denied if a condition defined as HCAC for a member existed prior to the initiation of treatment for that member by that provider.” | No impact on reimbursement | Document pre‑existing status in medical record | Applies to both HCAC and OPPC. |
| **Clinical Review** | “Claims may be subject to clinical review for appropriate reimbursement consideration.” | Possible adjustment or denial | Provide supporting documentation; may request additional records | Review is at Anthem’s discretion. |

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The policy (G‑05016) governs the reimbursement of **preventive medicine visits and sick visits performed on the same day** for New York Medicaid beneficiaries under Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP.  Anthem will pay both services when the provider follows the required coding and billing guidelines.  The payment is based on the fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate for each service, provided that the sick‑visit E/M code is billed with Modifier 25 and appropriate diagnosis codes are used.  Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health centers (RHCs) are excluded from this policy.

> “Anthem allows reimbursement for preventive medicine and sick visits on the same day… Reimbursement is based on the fee schedule or contracted/negotiated rate for the preventive medicine and the allowed sick visit under the following conditions: • Modifier 25 must be billed with the applicable evaluation and management (E/M) code for the allowed sick visit. If Modifier 25 is not billed appropriately, the sick visit will be denied.”  
> (NY_ABC_CAID_RP_PreventativeandSickVisitsSameDay.pdf, p. 2)

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 25 Requirement** – The sick‑visit E/M code must carry Modifier 25; otherwise the sick visit will be denied.  
- **Diagnosis Coding** – Appropriate diagnosis codes must be billed for each visit; failure to do so can result in denial.  
- **Exclusions** – FQHCs and RHCs, which are reimbursed through other mechanisms, are not subject to this policy.  
- **Coverage Scope** – The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and facilities, unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid “Professional Anesthesia Services” policy (Policy # G‑07018) governs reimbursement for anesthesia performed by professional providers for covered members.  The policy is effective 11/06/2020 and was last approved 06/13/2023.  Reimbursement is calculated using the CMS‑approved allowance formula and time‑based increments, with all services billed in minutes and appropriate modifiers applied.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and requires that services meet authorization and medical‑necessity criteria.  Claims that do not follow the specified coding, billing, or documentation standards may be rejected, denied, or adjusted.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Basis** – “Reimbursement is based upon…the reimbursement formula for the allowance and time increments in accordance with CMS guidelines.”  Anesthesia must be reported in minutes; non‑minute reporting may lead to denial.  
- **Modifiers & Multiple Procedures** – “Anesthesia modifiers are appended…Claims submitted for anesthesiology services without the appropriate modifier will be denied.”  For multiple procedures, reimbursement is based on the highest‑valued anesthesia code plus the total time of all procedures.  
- **Obstetrical & Conjunction Services** – “Anthem allows reimbursement for professional neuraxial epidural anesthesia services…up to 300 minutes.”  Separate reimbursement is allowed for services such as Swan‑Ganz catheter insertion, central venous line insertion, emergency intubation, critical‑care visits, and transesophageal echocardiography, but only at the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rate.  
- **Non‑Reimbursable Items** – “Anthem does not reimburse for: Use of patient status modifiers or qualifying circumstances codes denoting additional complexity levels.”

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Proof of Timely Filing” policy (Policy # G‑06133) governs how Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield (NY) determines whether a claim was submitted within the required time limits for Medicaid services.  The policy applies to all participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities that submit claims for members covered under Anthem’s Medicaid plans.  It outlines the documentation that constitutes proof of receipt, the circumstances that may qualify as “Good Cause,” and the process for reconsideration of denied claims that fail timely‑filing requirements.  The policy is intended to provide a clear framework for accurate claim submission and to minimize delays or denials due to filing timing issues.  

> “Anthem will reconsider reimbursement of a claim that is denied for failure to meet timely filing requirements unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise when a provider can do one of the following: • Provide a date of claim receipt compliant with applicable timely filing requirements • Demonstrate Good Cause exists”【1†L1-L8】  

> “The following information will be considered proof the claim was received within the time period outlined in the Claims Timely Filing policy. If the claim is submitted: • By mail: The provider must provide official mailing service return receipt/delivery confirmation. Additionally, the provider must provide a copy of the claim log that identifies each claim included in the submission.”【1†L9-L15】  

> “The following information will not be considered proof the claim was received timely. If the claim is submitted: • By fax: Facsimile transmission • By hand delivery: A claim log that identifies each claim included in the delivery and a copy of the signed receipt”【1†L16-L20】  

**Key Points**

- **Proof of Receipt** – Claims submitted by mail must be accompanied by a return‑receipt/delivery confirmation and a claim log; electronic submissions must include the clearinghouse‑assigned receipt date. Fax or hand‑delivery submissions are *not* accepted as proof of timely filing.  
- **Good Cause** – A claim denied for untimely filing may be reconsidered if the provider can demonstrate Good Cause, such as unavoidable delays in obtaining required documentation, retroactive enrollment, or destruction of records not caused by negligence.  
- **Reconsideration Process** – Anthem will reconsider denied claims only if the provider supplies either a compliant receipt date or evidence of Good Cause; otherwise the denial stands.

The “Technology Assisted Surgical Procedures” policy (Policy # G‑10004) applies to all New York Medicaid beneficiaries covered by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP. It clarifies that the use of robotic or computer‑assisted surgical systems is **integral to the primary procedure** and is **not reimbursed separately**. The policy lists specific CPT/HCPCS codes (S2900, 0054T, 0055T) that are *not* reimbursable when billed in addition to the primary procedure. The intent is to prevent duplicate payment for technology‑assisted techniques and to align reimbursement with the primary surgical service.

> “Anthem does not allow separate or additional reimbursement for the use of technology assisted surgical procedures unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Technology assisted surgical procedures below in the Related Coding section are considered integral to the primary procedure and are considered included in the primary surgical procedure.”  
> “Reimbursement will be based on the payment for the primary surgical procedure(s), regardless of any instruments, supplies, techniques, or approaches used in a procedure, or increase in operating room use.”  
> “This code is not reimbursable” (for S2900, 0054T, 0055T).

**Key Points**

- **No separate payment** for robotic or computer‑assisted surgical techniques; they are bundled with the primary procedure.  
- **Codes S2900, 0054T, 0055T** are explicitly marked “not reimbursable” when listed in addition to the primary CPT/HCPCS code.  
- The policy applies to both **professional and facility** providers and is effective 11/01/2023.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem New York Medicaid “Split‑Care Surgical Modifiers” policy governs reimbursement for surgical procedures that are performed by more than one qualified provider (e.g., a surgeon and a pre‑ or post‑operative care provider).  The policy allows the use of modifiers 54, 55, and 56 to identify the portion of the global surgical package performed by each provider.  Reimbursement is calculated as a percentage of the fee schedule or contracted rate for the procedure, with the percentage determined by the modifier applied.  The total payment for a global surgical package is fixed and cannot exceed the amount that would have been paid if a single provider performed all components.  Claims that use split‑care modifiers after a global surgical claim has already been paid are denied.  Assistant‑surgeon and multiple‑procedure rules apply when relevant.  The policy applies to both participating and non‑participating providers and is subject to override by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Modifiers Covered** – Only CPT/HCPCS codes appended with **modifier 54 (surgical care only)**, **55 (post‑operative care only)**, or **56 (pre‑operative care only)** are reimbursable.  
- **Reimbursement Basis** – Payment is a *percentage* of the fee schedule or negotiated rate, with the percentage set by the specific modifier.  
- **Global Package Rule** – The total payment for the global surgical package (pre‑op, operative, post‑op) is the same regardless of how the services are split; the combined payment cannot exceed the single‑provider amount.  
- **Denial for Post‑Payment** – Claims that use split‑care modifiers after a global surgical claim has already been paid will be denied.  
- **Assistant‑Surgeon & Multiple‑Procedure Rules** – When an assistant surgeon is involved or multiple procedures are performed, the standard assistant‑surgeon and multiple‑procedure fee‑reduction rules apply.  
- **Coding Requirement** – The *same* surgical procedure code (with the appropriate modifier) must be used by each provider to document the services performed.  
- **Authorization & Medical Necessity** – Services must meet the usual authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines for the member’s benefit plan.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G‑06163) governs reimbursement for sterilization procedures performed to render a member permanently incapable of reproduction. Effective 07/17/2024, the policy applies to all participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities. Reimbursement is based on the fee schedule or negotiated rate and requires a state‑approved consent form that meets all statutory and policy requirements. The policy references ACOG, CMS, and state Medicaid regulations and is subject to change per state or federal mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Consent Requirements**  
  - Member must sign a valid, state‑approved consent form **30–180 calendar days** before the procedure (or within 72 hrs for emergency/abortion‑related cases).  
  - Consent must include signatures from the member (or authorized representative), interpreter (if needed), the person obtaining consent, and the performing physician.  
  - No valid consent → claim may be rejected or denied.  

- **Eligibility Criteria**  
  - Member must be **≥ 21 years** old, **legally and mentally competent**, and **not institutionalized** (e.g., mental hospital, correctional facility).  
  - Consent cannot be obtained while the member is in labor, under the influence of alcohol/other agents, or seeking/obtaining an abortion.  

- **Coding & Billing**  
  - Standard CPT/HCPCS coding applies.  
  - If performed concurrently with delivery, modifiers 50/51 (multiple/bilateral surgery) apply.  
  - Claims must be submitted with the consent form; failure to submit may result in denial or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy # G‑06004, effective 11/04/2024) provides guidance for the use of **unlisted or miscellaneous CPT/HCPCS codes**.  Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP will consider reimbursement on a claim‑by‑claim basis unless a provider, state, federal, or CMS contract specifically disallows it.  The policy applies to all professional and facility providers—participating or non‑participating—and requires that claims be coded with standard industry codes and fully supported by documentation.  Failure to meet these coding or documentation standards may result in claim denial, payment recovery, or adjustment.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Eligibility** – Unlisted/miscellaneous codes are reimbursable *unless* overridden by other contractual or regulatory requirements.  
- **Documentation Requirements** – Claims must include:  
  1. Written description, office notes, or operative report of the service performed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G‑05022, effective 11/04/2024) governs reimbursement for vaccine administration under the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.  Providers may receive an administration fee for each VFC‑eligible vaccine given to a member aged 18 or younger.  The fee is paid at the fee‑schedule or contracted rate, up to the maximum limits set by the CDC.  The vaccine serum itself is not reimbursed because it is supplied free of charge through VFC.  Claims must include the appropriate serum code(s) and administration code(s) with the correct modifiers to satisfy HEDIS® reporting and to avoid denial or adjustment.

**Key Points**

- **Eligibility & Coverage** – Reimbursement is available for the *administration* of VFC vaccines to Medicaid members ≤ 18 years, unless overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts.  
- **Fee Limits** – The administration fee is capped at the CDC‑established maximum fee schedule or the negotiated rate, with applicable modifiers.  
- **Serum Codes** – Providers must submit serum code(s) on the claim (even though no payment is made) to meet regulatory and HEDIS® reporting requirements; omission may lead to claim rejection or denial.  
- **Supply Shortages** – During documented state VFC supply shortages, Anthem will reimburse for serum(s) at the fee schedule or negotiated rate.  
- **Authorization & Medical Necessity** – Claims must meet standard authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines; failure to follow coding or billing guidelines can result in claim denial, recovery, or payment adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The New York Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield (NY ABC) Inpatient Readmission policy (Policy No. G‑13001) governs reimbursement for unplanned readmissions to the same or a different hospital within the same system.  Effective 3 / 25 / 2025, the policy applies to all inpatient facilities reimbursed under a Diagnosis‑Related Group (DRG) methodology.  It clarifies that a readmission occurring within 14 days of discharge for the same or a closely‑related condition is considered a single episode of care and is not reimbursed separately, unless a separate authorization is obtained or a state/federal contract overrides the policy.  The policy also defines exclusions, planned readmissions, and leave‑of‑absence scenarios, and requires that claims be coded and submitted in accordance with standard CPT/HCPCS and revenue‑code guidelines.

**Key Points**

- **Unplanned readmission definition** – A readmission within 14 days of discharge for the *same or closely‑related condition or procedure* is treated as a continuation of the initial admission and is not reimbursed separately.  
  *“Unplanned readmission up to 14 days from discharge…Same or closely related condition or procedure”*【1】.

- **Coverage criteria** – The subsequent admission must be for the same or closely‑related condition, an infection/complication, a failed surgical intervention, acute decompensation of a chronic disease, or a condition that could have been prevented by appropriate post‑discharge care.  
  *“Clinical coding criteria and/or licensed clinical medical review will be used to determine if the subsequent admission is for: …”*【2】.

- **Exclusions** – Readmissions for major/metastatic malignancy, multiple trauma, burns, infants <12 mo, SNF, LTAC, sickle‑cell anemia, neonatal, obstetrical treatment, planned readmissions, discharge against medical advice, and inter‑hospital transfers are excluded from the readmission rule.  
  *“Exclusions: …”*【3】.

- **Planned readmissions & leave of absence** – Readmissions within 30 days that are part of a planned readmission or a leave of absence are considered a single admission; only one DRG is reimbursed.  
  *“Leave of Absence…the admissions are considered to be one admission and only one DRG will be reimbursed.”*【3】.

- **Claim submission** – Readmissions on the same date of service for the same or related condition are treated as a continuation of the initial treatment; both admissions should be submitted on a single claim.  
  *“Readmissions occurring on the same day…Providers should submit both admissions on a single claim.”*【2】.

- **Authorization & medical necessity** – Claims must meet authorization and medical‑necessity guidelines; the policy reserves the right to deny or recoup payment for claims that fall within its scope.  
  *“The health plan reserves the right to deny the claim or to recoup and/or recover monies previously paid on a claim that falls within the guidelines of this policy.”*【2】.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield of New York (NY) Medicaid policy G‑01017 (“Preadmission Services for Inpatient Stays”) outlines when pre‑admission services are reimbursable and when they are included in the inpatient payment. The policy applies to all Anthem‑covered Medicaid members and is effective 12 Nov 2023. It follows CMS guidance and specifies that pre‑admission services are generally bundled into the inpatient stay reimbursement, except for certain facilities (e.g., Critical Access Hospitals) and services outside the payment window (ambulance, dialysis, skilled nursing, home health, hospice, unrelated nondiagnostic services).  

**Key Points**  

- **Bundled Services** – For admitting hospitals, all pre‑admission services are included in the inpatient reimbursement for the **three (3) days prior to and including the admission day**.  
- **Other Facilities** – Inpatient rehabilitation, psychiatric, long‑term care, children’s, and cancer hospitals include pre‑admission services in the inpatient reimbursement for **one (1) day prior to and including the admission day**.  
- **Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)** – Preadmission services are **separately reimbursable**; the 3‑day or 1‑day payment window does **not** apply.  
- **Excluded Services** – Ambulance, maintenance renal dialysis, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospices, and unrelated nondiagnostic services are **outside** the payment window and may be billed separately.  
- **Coding** – Standard CPT/HCPCS codes apply; a hospital may use condition code 51 to bill a nondiagnostic service separately if it is unrelated.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The “Provider Preventable Conditions” policy (Policy # G‑20003) is a New York Medicaid reimbursement guideline issued by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield HP. It establishes that Anthem will **not reimburse** for services related to **Provider Preventable Conditions (PPCs)**—including Health‑Care‑Acquired Conditions (HCACs) and Other Provider Preventable Conditions (OPPCs)—unless a state, federal, or CMS contract specifically overrides this rule. The policy applies to all participating and non‑participating professional providers and facilities, and requires that claims for PPCs be submitted with a “no‑pay” Type‑of‑Bill (0110) and that the member be held harmless.  

> “Anthem does not reimburse for Provider Preventable Conditions (PPC) unless provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise.”  
> “Neither the professional provider nor facility may seek payment from the member for the nonreimbursable services related to a PPC. The member must be held harmless.”  

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Exclusion** – No reimbursement for any PPC (HCAC or OPPC) unless an overriding contract exists.  
- **OPPC Definition** – Includes surgical or invasive procedures performed on the wrong body part, wrong patient, or wrong surgery.  
- **Claim Handling** – PPC‑related services must be billed on a Type‑of‑Bill 0110 (no‑pay) claim; all other services from the same admission are submitted separately.  
- **Documentation & Review** – Anthem may request additional records and may conduct clinical review before denying or adjusting payment.  
- **Member Protection** – Providers cannot bill members for PPC services; the member is protected from payment.
