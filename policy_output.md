**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The **CAID Restriction Automation Template** is a spreadsheet used by Anthem to automate the application of specialty‑based restrictions on California Medicaid (CAID) claims.  It contains a master list of provider specialty codes, their effective and termination dates, and the taxonomy codes that must accompany each specialty.  The template also provides a “User Reference Guide” that explains the required data fields, formatting rules, and alternate ID information (state license, DEA, etc.) that must be entered to avoid claim fallout.  The intent of the policy is to ensure that only authorized provider specialties submit CAID claims and that all required data are captured correctly for automated processing.

**Key Points**

- **Specialty Coding & Dates** – Every claim must include a valid specialty code from the list and the correct effective or termination date.  The “User Reference Guide” stresses that dates must be entered in *mm/dd/yyyy* format and that the cell format must be set to “date” rather than “text” to prevent processing delays.  
  *Source:* “Specialty Effective Date … Date (mm/dd/yyyy) … Ensure cell format is set to “date” format rather than “text” format to avoid processing delays.”  

- **Provider vs. Organization Specialties** – The list distinguishes between *Provider (P)* and *Organization (O)* specialties.  Organization specialties are valid for all states (including CA, CO, VA, and CA CAID) and may use a taxonomy code or description.  Provider specialties are state‑specific and may be restricted to CA, CO, NV, or CA CAID.  
  *Source:* “Provider Organization Specialty … Organization (O) Specialties may use Code or Description indicated on the Provider Specialty List tab. Organization specialties are valid for all states (to include CA, CO, VA, and CA Caid). Refer to Provider Specialty Tab.”  

- **Alternate ID Requirements** – For each provider the template requires alternate identifiers such as state license number, issuing institution, license effective/termination dates, and state DEA number.  These fields are mandatory for CAID claims and must be populated correctly to avoid claim denial.  
  *Source:* “Alt ID | State License Number … Alt ID | State DEA …”

**Provider Specialty List (excerpt)**  
The template includes a comprehensive list of specialty codes.  A few examples are:

| Code | Specialty | State Eligibility | Type |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------|
| `8073` | Clinical Medical Laboratory | All states | O |
| `D14Q0T9ZYC` | Clinical Nurse Specialist | CA, CO, NV, CA CAID | P |
| `8211` | Pediatric Physical Therapy | All states | P |
| `P0N612VXB7` | Pediatric Pulmonology | CA, CO, NV, CA CAID | P |

*Source:* “Provider Specialty List” section of the template.  

These elements together define the CAID Restriction Automation policy: only claims that match the listed specialties, dates, and alternate IDs will be accepted; all other claims will be rejected or flagged for manual review."

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This document is the *Request for Authorization – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Testing* form used by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield for New York Medicaid (NYC ABC CAID). It outlines the criteria for medically‑necessary ASD testing, the required documentation, and the authorization process. The form is intended only for ASD testing; other psychological or neuropsychological evaluations (e.g., educational testing, learning‑disability assessment, placement, disability, or forensic evaluations) are excluded and should be directed to the appropriate agencies.  

**Key Points**  
- **Medical Necessity** – Formal psychological testing is *not* indicated for routine screening or brief behavioral inventories; a diagnostic interview and relevant screening measures must precede any testing request.  
- **Scope of Coverage** – Only ASD‑specific testing is covered; requests for ABA services, educational testing, or other psychological evaluations are not covered under this form.  
- **Documentation & Authorization** – Clinicians must attach clinical/medical records, provide a detailed rationale for testing, and specify CPT® code(s) (e.g., 96130 for the first hour). Prior authorization is required before services are rendered.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
The NY E CAID Overpayment Refund Notification policy provides the procedure for submitting a refund of an over‑payment made to a provider under New York Medicaid or Medicare Advantage plans administered by Anthem.  The policy requires that a completed “Overpayment Refund Notification Form” be mailed to Anthem along with the refund check and any supporting documentation.  The form must list the reason for the refund (e.g., duplicate payment, contract rate change, wrong member, etc.) and include all provider and member identifiers.  After Anthem’s Cost Containment unit reviews the submission, a reconciliation letter will be sent to the provider.  The policy also reminds providers that they may not disclose protected health information (PHI) about patients they do not treat or who are not enrolled in their practice.

**Key Points**
